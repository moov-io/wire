Moov's mission is to give developers an easy way to create and integrate bank processing into their own software products. Our open source projects are each focused on solving a single responsibility in financial services and designed around performance, scalability, and ease of use.

Wire implements a reader, writer, and validator for Fed Wire Messages (Fedwire) in an HTTP server and Go library. The HTTP server is available in a Docker image and the Go package `github.com/moov-io/wire` is available.
